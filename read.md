This project is a Flask-based multi-modal Parkinson’s Disease Prediction System that processes voice features, MRI images, and drawing patterns. Each input is analyzed using specialized models including SVM/XGBoost, CNN, and CNN-LSTM for accurate feature extraction and prediction. The outputs are fused and displayed through a Next.js interface, delivering a unified and reliable diagnosis result.
